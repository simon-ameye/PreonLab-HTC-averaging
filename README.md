# PreonLab-HTC-averaging
This simple Python script will average your PreonLab heat transfer and HTC for E-motor, engine (and averything that rotates) simulations.

#Make sure HF sensors activity is on for the last rotation and inactive outside
#Make sure the HF sensors are linked with MeasuredScalarValue with a reference sensor plane (for global HTCs)
#Also make sure that current_dir and scene_name are filled
#Of course, make sure that each sensor has data (is post processed) in your PreonLab scene, at least during activity
